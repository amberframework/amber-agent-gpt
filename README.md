# What is AgentC?

Inspired by Auto-GPT and BabyAGI, this is a cli tool that acts as an "agent" for LLMs and allows for longer term memory. I found the other tools not to be that great and I don't enjoy the python language nearly as much as I do the Crystal language, so here is my version!

This tool does a few things (in my opinion) better:

[x] Saves your primary agent configuration into a ~/.agentc folder instead of using the app folder
[x] Saves your goals using local storage under the same ~/.agentc folder
[x] Refines goals so that they can be worked.
[] Creates plans for goals
[] Add Pinecone client
[] All of the standard capabilities are working
[] All default features are tested


## Installation

`git clone` the repo and run `crystal run src/agentc.cr`
## Usage

Currently in development, so unless you're contributing I don't recommend trying this tool out.
